# Self_Organization
The molecular mechanisms of self-organization that orchestrate embryonic cells to create astonishing patterns have been among major questions of developmental biology. It is recently shown that embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when cultured in particular micropatterns, can self-organize and mimic early steps of pre-implantation embryogenesis. A systems-biology model to address this observation from a dynamical systems perspective is essential. Here, we propose a multicellular mathematical model for pattern formation during in vitro gastrulation of human ESCs. This model enhances the basic principles of Waddington epigenetic landscape with cell-cell communication, in order to enable pattern and tissue formation. We have used a minimal number of parameters in this model to prevent overfitting and show a very simple mechanism is sufficient to address different experimental observations such as the formation of three germ layers and trophectoderm, responses to altered culture conditions and micropattern diameters, and unexpected spotted forms of the germ layers under certain conditions. Moreover, we have tested different boundary conditions as well as various shapes, observed that the pattern is initiated from the boundary and gradually spread towards the center. This model provides a basis for in-silico modeling of self-organization.
